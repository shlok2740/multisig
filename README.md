# Multi Signature Wallet

This project implements a Multi Signature Wallet smart contract using Hardhat. A Multi Signature Wallet is a type of cryptocurrency wallet that requires multiple signatures to authorize a transaction. This increases security by ensuring that no single party can unilaterally control the funds.

A Multi Signature Wallet is akin to a bank vault that requires multiple keys to open. In this setup, you can specify how many keys are needed to authorize a transaction. For example, in a 2-of-3 Multi Signature Wallet, any two out of three designated key holders must sign a transaction for it to be executed. This setup is commonly used by organizations, investment funds, and crypto exchanges to enhance security and distribute control over funds.
